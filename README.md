# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease using clinical data. The project utilizes three machine learning models: **Random Forest**, **AdaBoost**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

### Key Highlights:
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains 918 rows and 12 features such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and others.
- **Models**: 
  - **Random Forest**: Achieved **89.49% accuracy** with high precision and recall.
  - **AdaBoost**: Achieved **87.32% accuracy**, performing well across both classes.
  - **SVM**: Achieved **89.13% accuracy**, with strong recall for the positive class.

### Performance:
- **Random Forest**:
  - Accuracy: 89.49%
  - Precision: 0.91 for class 0, 0.88 for class 1
  - F1-score: 0.89 for both classes
- **AdaBoost**:
  - Accuracy: 87.32%
  - Precision: 0.85 for class 0, 0.89 for class 1
  - F1-score: 0.87 for both classes
- **SVM**:
  - Accuracy: 89.13%
  - Precision: 0.93 for class 0, 0.87 for class 1
  - F1-score: 0.89 for both classes

### Conclusion:
The **Random Forest** model outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy and overall performance. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart disease and assists in making informed clinical decisions.
